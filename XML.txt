XML
	all tags are valid
	
	XML does not require this line but if it is inclueded it must be first
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
	
	all documents require a closing tag
	close documents in the order you open them

	< will generate an error as it is a reserved character
	use &lt; instead
	
	error:	use instead:

	<	&lt;
	>	&gt;
	&	&amp;
	'	&apos;
	"	&quot;

	<!-- This is a comment -->
	XML does not remove whitespace
	
	avoid attributes if:
		multiple values required
		tree structure 
		the value must be expanded or changed
